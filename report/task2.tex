The identification of user, software, and system requirements were scraped and
    analyzed from the Google Play Store, both from the app's description and its
    reviews.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Analyzing WhatsApp Messenger's Google Play Reviews}

The following explanation of the analysis of WhatsApp Messenger's reviews is a
    summary of the Jupyter Notebook in Appendix \ref{sec:data_preprocessing}.

Using the
    \href{https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/}{google-play-scraper}
    Python library, reviews were scraped from the Google Play Store.
Initially, 328,500 reviews were scraped, most of which were under 10 words.
This is shown in the histogram below.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{data_preprocessing_files/data_preprocessing_9_0.png}
\end{figure}
To reduce the amount of data to analyze, all reviews under 10 words were
    removed.
Additional filters were applied, like removing non-English reviews with the
    \href{https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/}{langdetect} Python library.
The reviews were then split by their rating (5 stars: positive, 2-4 stars:
    mixed, 1 star: negative) and run through a
    \href
        {https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html}
        {Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm from Scikit Learn}
    to identify important topics from each category of the reviews.

\subsection*{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}

The analysis of negative reviews led to some recurring topics, which included
    banning of accounts without warning,
    lack of support if a user's account was hacked,
    and the prevalence of scam messages.

\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{USER-01}]
        The user should not be banned without first receiving a warning for a
            specific behavior.
    \item[\textbf{USER-02}]
        If a user's account is banned, the user should receive a thorough and
            transparent explanation of why the ban happened.
    \item[\textbf{USER-03}]
        The user needs to have protection against people hacking into their
            account.
    \item[\textbf{USER-04}]
        The user needs to have access to support in the event of someone hacking
            into their account.
    \item[\textbf{USER-05}]
        The user needs to have the option to block all messages from unknown
            accounts to prevent scam attempts.
\end{description}

\subsection*{User Requirements from Mixed Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{User Requirements from Mixed Reviews}

When analyzing the mixed reviews, some recurring topics were
    backups of chat history,
    and multi-factor authentication/verification steps.

\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{USER-01}]
        The user needs to be able to choose which chats to backup.
    \item[\textbf{USER-02}]
        Upon a backup failure, the user needs to be informed why the backup
            failed so that they can take action to fix the issue.
    \item[\textbf{USER-03}]
        The user needs to reload chats from a backup file.
    \item[\textbf{USER-04}]
        The user needs to be able to enable multi-factor authentication.
    \item[\textbf{USER-05}]
        Upon a failure with multi-factor authentication, the user needs to be
            informed why the verification failed.
\end{description}

\subsection*{User Requirements from Positive Reviews}

    video and voice calling,
    messaging,
    fast communication,
    easy-to-use interface,
