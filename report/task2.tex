\subsection*{User Requirements from GrandPad's Description and Website}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{User Requirements from GrandPad's Description and Website}

The following user requirements were created from analyzing GrandPad's goals and
    desired outcomes for families.
The Google Play Store description contains many needs that GrandPad claims to
    satisfy \cite{grandpad_google_play}, and the GrandPad website lists
    product details that fill gaps for its users \cite{grandpad_product_details}.

\begin{description}

\subsection*{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}

Next, the reviews from the GrandPad Google Play Store app were analyzed.
The following explanation of the analysis of GrandPad's reviews is a summary of
    the Jupyter Notebook in Appendix \ref{sec:reviews_processing_notebook}.

Using the
    \href{https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/}{google-play-scraper}
    Python library, reviews were scraped from the Google Play Store.
Initially, 1,823 reviews were scraped, many of which were under 10 words.
This is shown in the histogram below.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/word_length_distribution.png}
\end{figure}
To reduce the amount of data to analyze, all reviews under 10 words were
    removed.
The reviews were then split by their rating (5 stars: positive, 2-4 stars:
    mixed, 1 star: negative) and run through a
    \href
        {https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html}
        {Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm from Scikit Learn}
    to identify important topics from each category of the reviews.

\subsubsection*{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}

The analysis of negative reviews led to some recurring topics, which included
    lack of professional support,
    intrusive app behavior,
    lack of personalization functionality,
    poor quality of video and voice calls,
    and frustrating notification experience.

\end{description}

\subsubsection*{User Requirements from Mixed Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{User Requirements from Mixed Reviews}

When analyzing the mixed reviews, some recurring topics were
    connecting multiple GrandPad tablets to a single network,
    being part of multiple networks,
    editing posts and comments,
    vague error messages,
    posting/downloading multiple files at once,
    and sending message to or calling specific people in a network.

        As a caregiver of an elderly family member, I want to send messages to
            or call the elderly member specifically so that I can check up on
            them.
\end{description}

\section*{Comparison of User Requirements and Functional Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Comparison of User Requirements and Functional Requirements}

Many of the user requirements translated directly into functional requirements.
The user requirements expressed a need that a user (or a specific group of
    users) should have satisfied by the system.
The requirements were worded like ``As a user, I need ... because ...'',
    expressing that the user has a certain goal for a certain reason.
User requirements are written from the perspective of the user, and as a result
    there is no restriction on what the user will do.
Unlike the system, the user is not what we control.
Instead, the user is a stakeholder whose needs must be met.

The functional requirements were primarily adapted from the user requirements.
Since the functional requirements describe the system, which is under the
    control of the developers, the requirements are written like ``The system
    shall ...'' to express the specific behaviors the system must exhibit.
By analyzing a group of user requirements and asking what the system needs to do
    to satisfy them, functional requirements are discovered.
All the functional requirements are testable, in that the system's performance
    can be measured and checked against the requirements, and a clear pass or
    fail will result.

\section*{Impact of Domain Requirements on the Software Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Impact of Domain Requirements on the Software Requirements}

The domain requirements for GrandPad primarily result from two areas:
    elderly care
    and telecommunications.

\subsection*{Domain Requirements for Elderly Care}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Domain Requirements for Elderly Care}

\begin{description}
    \item[DOM-ELDER-01]
        Senior technology users need protection, or education, from online scams
            and exploitations.
    \item[DOM-ELDER-02]
        The technology used by seniors should have the ability to configure
            their UI to accommodate users with differing levels of comfort with
            technology use.
\end{description}

These requirements influenced the functional requirements regarding the
    administration of private social networks (\textbf{FUNC-NET}) and support
    staff (\textbf{FUNC-HELP}).
The functional requirements effectively delegate the responsibility of scam
    protection and UI configuration to the family members that take an
    administrative role, along with trusted support staff to help if needed.
Functional requirements \textbf{FUNC-UI-01} and \textbf{FUNC-UI-05} are also
    impacted by these domain requirements, as they involve the ease of use of
    the UI for users of all levels of technology experience.

\subsection*{Domain Requirements for Telecommunications}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Domain Requirements for Telecommunications}

\begin{description}
    \item[DOM-TELE-01]
        High definition 720p resolution video calling requires a data rate of at
            least 1.2Mbps \cite{zoom_system_requirements}.
    \item[DOM-TELE-02]
        High quality video calling requires a data rate of at least 600kbps
            \cite{zoom_system_requirements}.
    \item[DOM-TELE-03]
        Voice calling requires a data rate of at least 100kbps
            \cite{zoom_system_requirements}.
\end{description}

These requirements influenced the functional requirements related to video and
    voice calling (\textbf{FUNC-CALL}).
Since these set limits for the ability to maintain a call with one or more
    people, the functionality that GrandPad must exhibit will depend on these
    limits.
