The identification of user, software, and system requirements were scraped and
    analyzed from the Google Play Store, both from the app's description and its
    reviews, and from \href{https://www.grandpad.net/}{GrandPad's website}.

\section*{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Description and Website}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Description and Website}

First, analysis was conducted on the description of the GrandPad app on the
    Google Play Store and from their website.

\subsection*{User Requirements from GrandPad's Description and Website}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{User Requirements from GrandPad's Description and Website}

The following user requirements were created from analyzing GrandPad's goals and
    desired outcomes for families.
The Google Play Store description contains many needs that GrandPad claims to
    satisfy \cite{grandpad_google_play}, and the GrandPad website lists
    product details that fill gaps for its users \cite{grandpad_product_details}.

\section*{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}

Next, the reviews from the GrandPad Google Play Store app were analyzed.
The following explanation of the analysis of GrandPad's reviews is a summary of
    the Jupyter Notebook in Appendix \ref{sec:reviews_processing_notebook}.

Using the
    \href{https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/}{google-play-scraper}
    Python library, reviews were scraped from the Google Play Store.
Initially, 1,823 reviews were scraped, many of which were under 10 words.
This is shown in the histogram below.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/word_length_distribution.png}
\end{figure}
To reduce the amount of data to analyze, all reviews under 10 words were
    removed.
The reviews were then split by their rating (5 stars: positive, 2-4 stars:
    mixed, 1 star: negative) and run through a
    \href
        {https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html}
        {Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm from Scikit Learn}
    to identify important topics from each category of the reviews.
