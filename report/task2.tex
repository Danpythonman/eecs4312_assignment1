The identification of user, software, and system requirements were scraped and
    analyzed from the Google Play Store, both from the app's description and its
    reviews.

\section*{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Analyzing GrandPad's Google Play Reviews}

The following explanation of the analysis of GrandPad's reviews is a summary of
    the Jupyter Notebook in Appendix \ref{sec:reviews_processing_notebook}.

Using the
    \href{https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/}{google-play-scraper}
    Python library, reviews were scraped from the Google Play Store.
Initially, 1,823 reviews were scraped, many of which were under 10 words.
This is shown in the histogram below.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/word_length_distribution.png}
\end{figure}
To reduce the amount of data to analyze, all reviews under 10 words were
    removed.
The reviews were then split by their rating (5 stars: positive, 2-4 stars:
    mixed, 1 star: negative) and run through a
    \href
        {https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html}
        {Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm from Scikit Learn}
    to identify important topics from each category of the reviews.

\subsection*{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{User Requirements from Negative Reviews}

The analysis of negative reviews led to some recurring topics, which included
    lack of professional support,
    intrusive app behavior,
    lack of personalization functionality,
    poor quality of video and voice calls,
    and frustrating notification experience.

    vague error messages,
    posting multiple files at once,
    and sending message to or calling specific people in a network.
