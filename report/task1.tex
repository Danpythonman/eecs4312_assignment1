Loneliness in aging populations is an important issue, especially in Canada.

\section*{Introduction and Background}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction and Background}

The well-being of the elderly population is strongly correlated to the quality
    of their social lives.
Loneliness substantially increases the risk of depression, mood disorders, and
    feelings of hopelessness in the elderly \cite{golden}.
This problem is especially daunting in Canada, where, according to estimates by
    the Government of Canada, 40\% of Canadian adults will be seniors by 2038
    \cite{canada}.

Many apps exist that aim to fulfill the need of maintaining social connections
    and staying in contact with friends and family.
Out of these apps and services, WhatsApp Messenger stands out in its ability to
    meet user needs.

WhatsApp Messenger
    (Google Play ID \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp\&hl=en}{com.whatsapp})
    is primarily a messaging and calling app.

The app's goals are to provide instant messaging and high-quality video-calling
    in real-time across the world with secure connections.
As a simple, no-frills service to stay connected with loved ones, WhatsApp
    Messenger provides an easy-to-use app that can be utilized to maintain
    social connections across geographical barriers.

Research conducted on this topic, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,
    where social isolation was the norm, has shown that WhatsApp Messenger
    played a substantial role in helping older adults stay connected with family
    and friends \cite{llorente}.
The app was praised for its ease of use and its agility, both of which are
    valuable to elderly users \cite{llorente}.

WhatsApp especially showed its value when compared with other social media
    services, like Facebook, whose newsfeed-style platforms have mixed results
    in fostering meaningful socialization.
Currently, WhatsApp stands out to be a leading tool in the category of social
    services apps for maintaining connections \cite{longjing}.
