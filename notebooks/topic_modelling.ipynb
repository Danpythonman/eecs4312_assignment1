      "TOPIC 2: I really hate how the files sent to you can't be downloaded after a time just because the sender deletes their account. Why did I back up then? It asks to be resend by the sender. Why should they resend it when they already did and I made a backup? I lost important photos cause of that.\n",
      "TOPIC 1: While I like WhatsApp for the ability to call family and friends, the most annoying feature is the chat backup feature. Even though I have this feature turned off and don't want it, I keep getting reminders on my phone that my chats aren't backed up.

      "TOPIC 1: The app is great, but would be better of your app had a bot like jinx in kik, it has games, definition, ranking system and score system.

      "TOPIC 2: Unable to restore backup from Google drive. Old phone is backed up of Google drive I just cannot restore it. I can't do the transfer because it's the same number and one phone logs off the other. How can you transfer using a QR code. The instructions make it appear that you can have WhatsApp running on two devices with the same number but you can't. The other phone logs you out. I would like all the group chats on new phone, it can't get them. Disappointing. Very.\n",
      "TOPIC 2: Lately when we reinstall the App it doesn't restore photos and videos saved in the previous backup. We tried all steps mentioned on your website but still the issue till suddenly with a reinstall trial it works then starts to show restoring media!! Which means it is bug in your App!

      "TOPIC 1: Whilst I do love the app, I was using the beta version (loved the organisation of that) which meant that despite daily backups when I needed to reinstall the app, I've lost all of my chat history. The help function isn't helpful at all either as the person replying isn't reading my message saying I need to backup.\n",

      "TOPIC 2: It keeps sending multiple notifications daily that it's unable to do a back up even though I told it to \"never\" and now currently only when I press backup. I use it for a near monthly video call only. I don't need or want back up of it yet still keeps demanding I do back ups.\n",
      "TOPIC 2: The fact that WhatsApp does not warn you when installing and starting up on a new device that you need to have a backup on the previous device, well that's just bloody stupid. I have ALWAYS had a backup and been using WhatsApp over 10 years. Something happened and it was disabled. I have lost 10 years of chats and photos. While backs up all the photos, and I can recover the chats, they are no longer together. Can no longer see the photos sent within the chats context. Should save ON the phone!!!\n",

      "TOPIC 1: Works well enough. Easy to use and doesn't get in the way. I just wish I could turn off the 'updates' and 'communities' tabs. They are absolutely useless and I will intentionally never use them. I also wish that the chat backups were placed in a hidden folder. Currently my file manager app is cluttered with 'new' backups at the top of my list every day that have no business being there. Other than that, good app.\n",

This feature would allow new members to view previous conversations, helping them understand the ongoing discussion when they join a group.

But I don't want to be disturbed by that chat on my days off. There should be a way around this. Such as putting more options on the amount of allotted times for \"muting\".

Also, disappearing messages should be set individually, that is, the settings of dissapearing messages from one person should not affect the settings of the other person as the other person might be keeping the message for record purpose.

Every single time I open a conversation, I have to scroll to the bottom, past about 20 or so messages so I can see the new one. It's irritating because you sometimes reply to a message you forgot that you've already read and replied to. Then the stickers that move are just not moving anymore. Keep it simple like it was.

I was added to an investment group without my knowledge or consent. Most people would freak out of that kind of scenario, thinking that the app is compromised. Before I give it a 5 star the user should have the option to accept or decline a community chat invite.\n",

Not everyone may find it useful, and it would be great if you could add an option in the Settings menu to enable or disable the Meta AI feature. This way, those who want to use Meta AI can enable it, while those who don't need it can keep it disabled. This would make the experience more customizable and user-friendly for everyone.\n",
